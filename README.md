# hotel-full-stack

This is my first full stack project. 
I will use Spring boot and Angular to make my project.
My aim is to gain experience and learn this two technologies through this project.
This project will be set like this:
User has three roles - USER, ADMIN and MODERATOR.
USER can see all hotels, available rooms, can search hotels by town, make and cancel reservation.
ADMIN can add hotels, rooms, users, edit, update and delete.
MODERATOR can add rooms, edit, update and delete them (only in his hotel).
I will make complete user registration and e-mail verification of account.
